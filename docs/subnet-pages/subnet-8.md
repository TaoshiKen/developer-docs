Proprietary Trading Network (PTN)

## Netuid

## Description

PTN receives signals from quant and deep learning machine learning trading systems to deliver the world's most complete trading signals across a variety of asset classes.

PTN is the most challenging & competitive network in the world. Our miners need to provide futures based signals (long/short) that are highly efficient and effective across various markets to compete (forex, crypto, indices). The top miners are those that provide the most returns, while never exceeding certain drawdown limits.
